    You are summarizing a Dungeons & Dragons session for the Dungeon Master.

    Below are detailed chunk summaries from the session. Each chunk may include structured notes like: Characters, Locations, Quests, Dramatic Beats, and Conclusions.

    Please use this information to write a full and detailed session recap, organized in the following format:

    ---

    **Session Summary**  
    Begin with a 3â€“5 paragraph cinematic narrative that recounts the session events as a cohesive story. Focus on the major events, twists, character decisions, and turning points. This should read like a DM's recap or campaign journal entry.

    ---

    **Player Focus Summary**  
    Summarize what each player character did or focused on this session. Use the character names and highlight their motivations, challenges, and contributions to the party's progress.

    ---

    **Locations Visited**  
    List all named or noteworthy locations that the party visited or interacted with during the session. Include brief context for each (e.g., what happened there).

    ---

    **NPCs Encountered**  
    List all named NPCs mentioned in the session. Describe their role, relationship to the players, and any significant actions or dialogue.

    ---

    **Quests & Discoveries**  
    Note all quest updates, new leads, completed objectives, or important discoveries made during the session.

    ---

    **Dramatic & Emotional Moments**  
    Summarize the emotional highs and lows of the session. Highlight any roleplay-heavy scenes, character conflicts, unexpected consequences, or powerful thematic moments.

    ---

    Keep the tone clear and cinematic. Help the DM remember key beats and prep for follow-ups. Ensure the summary connects events to character arcs and campaign threads.
